## Processor pipeline

### Learning objectives

* Design a processor pipeline

#### Keywords

Pipeline. Pipeline registers.

### Why?

In single-cycle implementation, the clock cycle time 
is determined by the slowest instruction. 

The execution of instrution does not need all hardware
module at the same time. For example, after an instruction
is fetched from the instruction memory, the instrution memory
is idle during the execution of the instruction.

### How?

Divide the execution of instruction into stages.

* IF. Instruction fetch.

* ID. Instruction decoding and register file read.

* EX. ALU computes the result.

* MEM. Access data memory.

* WB. Write result back to the register file.

We will discuss how instructions are executed in the pipeline.
