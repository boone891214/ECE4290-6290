## Data Hazards

### Learning objectives

* Deal with data hazards in pipeline

#### Keywords

Data hazard, data forwarding/bypassing, load use hazards.

### Data hazards

Instructions may not be able to get correct operands from 
the register file because the instruciton that generates
the value is not completed yet. 

In the following example, The OR instruction reads register
file in Cycle 2. However, the new value of x1 is being computed
by ALU in Cycle 2. It is not in the register file.  

```
                0       1       2       3       4       5
add  x1,        IF      ID      EX      MEM     WB
or   x2,x1              IF      ID
```

### Data forwarding/bypassing

We can forward the data to the component that needs it. The data
is not written into register file yet. 

We can remove many data hazards by forwarding. However, some 
cannot be removed.
