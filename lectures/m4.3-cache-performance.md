## Cache performance

### Learning objectives

* Evaluae cache performance

* Methods to improve cache performance

#### Keywords

Hit time, Miss penalty, miss rate, memory stall cycles, 
AMAT, set associativity, multi-level cache.

### Cache performance

Memory opratoins result in more stall cycles. We discuss how the number of
memory stall cycles are computed and analyze how it affects computer
performance.  

Average memory access time (AMAT) is calcuated as:

    AMAT = Hit time + Miss rate * Miss penalty

### Improve cache performance

We discuss how the following parameters affect the cache performance.

*   Cache size
*   Block size
*   Set associativity
*   Multi-level cache
