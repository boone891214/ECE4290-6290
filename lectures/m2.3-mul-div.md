## Multiplication and division hardware

### Learning objectives

* Design of multiplier 

* Design of division hardware

* RISC-V support for integer multiplicaton and division

#### Keywords

Multiplier, division, RISC-V M-extension.

### Multiplier

A state machine that performs n-bit multiplicaton in n cycles. 

### Division hardware

A state machine that performs n-bit division in n+1 cycles. 

### RISC-V Support for Multiplication and Division

The instructions are in RISC-V M extension. They are:

```
mul, mulh, mulhu, mulhsu
div, rem, divu, remu
```

Division hardware does not check if the divisor is 0.
