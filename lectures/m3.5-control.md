### Control hazards

Branch instruction may change instruction flow. Until the condition is
resolved, the processor does not know where to fetch instructions. 

In the following example, the BEQ instruction compares
x1 and x2 in Cycle 2 and the the correct address for the next instruction 
is selected in Cycle 3. Before that, the processor does not know if the OR
instruction should be executed or not. 

```
                0       1       2       3       4       5
beq  x1,x2,L    IF      ID      EX      MEM     WB
or                      IF      ID
```

### Method to reduce control hazards

There are several ways to deal with control hazards.

* Wait/stall. 

* Predicte not-taken. 

* Resovle condition early.

* Static branch prediction.

* Dynamic branch prediction.
