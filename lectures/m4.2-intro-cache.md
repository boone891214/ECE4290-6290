Write buffer. Write allocate. No write allocate. Dirty bit.

### Cache

Cache size is the amount of data we can keep in cache, typically in bytes,
e.g., 64 KiB and 2 MiB.

The total number bits include the additional bits we need for cache operation.
For direct-mapped cache, the overhead includes tags and status bits.

We assume the pipeline stalls on cache miss because in the simple pipeline we
have designed, the performance does not improve if we allow earlier
instructions to continue.

### Write

The strategies to handle write hit are write through and write back.  With
write through, both cache and memory are also updated . Cache and memory are
consistent. With write back, only cache is updated. The dirty bit indicates
a cache block is updated. When it is evicted from cache, it is written to memory.

The strategies to handle write miss are write allocate or no write allocate.
