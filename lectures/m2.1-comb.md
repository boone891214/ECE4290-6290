## Combinational circuit

### Learning objectives

* Review Boolean algebra, truth table, etc.

* Describe basic logic gates

* Write logic equations from truth table

* Build basic combinational modules

#### Keywords

Gates, Boolean algebra, truth table, encoder, decoder, multiplexor, 
adder, ALU 

### Write logic equations

Write a product term for each row where the funciton outputs 1, 
and then OR the product terms together.

### Combinational modules

Decoder asserts one and only one ouput specifed by the input.

Multiplexor selects one out of several inputs.

Adder. Carry ripple adder. Adder can also perform subtraction.

ALU can perfomr arithemtic and logical operatons. Multiple results
are generated and we use a multiplexor to select the one we like.

We build 32-bit ALU from 1-bit ALU.
