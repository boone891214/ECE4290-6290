## Building a processor

### Learning objectives

The main goal is to build a RISC-V processor. 

* Identify instructions to be supported on the processor.

* Construct datapath.

* Design combinational circuit to generate all control signals.

#### Keywords

Datapath, control. 

### A processor

We build a processor that executes an instruction per cycle. 

#### Instructions 

The set of instructions that the processor includes the following:

```
R-Type: add, sub, and, or

Load:   lw

Store:  sw

Branch: beq 
```

We will improve the processor in homework.

#### Datapath 

The major components are PC, register file, instruction memory, ALU, data
memory, multiplexors, and adders. 

ImmGen generates an immediate from 32-bit instruction. 

We will discuss how the processor executes each instruction and how the hardware
modules are used during execution.

#### Control

The main control generates control signals for components on the data path.

ALU control generates ALU operation from ALU Op and function code.
