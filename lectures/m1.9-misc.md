### Pseudoinstruction LA 

On 32-bit processors, LUI and ADDI can load any 32-bit constant into 
a register. We can use them to load any known address in a register. 

If we use the same method, we would need more instructions to load
an address on 64-bit processors.  

RISC-V's solution is to add the immediate formed by the LUI and ADDI 
sequence with PC. Two instructions can put any address around PC 
into a register, even on 64-bit processors.

Instruction AUIPC addes the immediate with PC. The immediate is
the same as the one in LUI.

One of the benefits is that the code and associated data can be moved to a
different location. The code will still work because the data location is
relative to the instruction location. 
 
### Pointers

Pointers can be faster 

Compiler can generate efficient code, converting array operations into 
pointers.  

### RISC and CISC

RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer/computing

CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer/computing

RISC-V is a typical RISC processor.

x86 is a typical CISC processor.
